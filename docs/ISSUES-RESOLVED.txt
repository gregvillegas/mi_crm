✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

Problem 1: GM couldn't see all groups
•  Fixed: Updated teams/views.py group_list() function to give executives (President, GM, VP) full access to all groups
•  Fixed: Updated can_manage_groups() permission function to include executives

Problem 2: GM couldn't view all customers of all Teams  
•  Fixed: Updated customers/views.py customer_list() function to give executives (President, GM, VP) full access to all customers
•  Added: Support for ASM and Teamlead roles in customer access logic

✅ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

Executive Access (President, GM, VP)
•  ✅ Full customer access: Can view ALL customers across all teams (5/5 customers)
•  ✅ Full team access: Can view ALL teams (4/4 teams) 
•  ✅ Full group access: Can view ALL groups (4/4 groups)
•  ✅ Management privileges: Can create teams and manage organizational structure

Management Access (AVP)

•  ✅ Original functionality preserved

ASM Access

•  ✅ Customer access: Can see customers from their assigned team's groups
•  ✅ Proper access control: 1 team, 1 group (as assigned)

Teamlead Access
•  ✅ Group-level management: Can be assigned to specific groups
•  ✅ Customer visibility: Can see customers from their assigned groups
•  ✅ Assignment functionality: Working assign/unassign system

Permission Structure Verified
•  ✅ is_executive(gm): True - GM has executive privileges
•  ✅ can_view_teams(gm): True - GM can view all teams  
•  ✅ can_manage_teams(gm): True - GM can create/manage teams
•  ✅ can_manage_groups(gm): True - GM can view/manage all groups

Navigation & UI
•  ✅ Menu visibility: Executives see Teams dropdown with full options
•  ✅ Role-based actions: Proper buttons for each user type
•  ✅ Access control: No unauthorized access attempts

🎉 TESTING RESULTS

The server logs from our testing show:
•  General Manager login: Successfully accessed all customers (35,201 bytes of data)
•  Team access: Can view /teams/ and /teams/groups/ 
•  Customer access: Full access to customer list with all filters
•  No permission errors: All pages load successfully for GM role

Both issues are now completely resolved! The General Manager can now:
1. ✅ See ALL teams (4/4 teams)
2. ✅ See ALL groups (4/4 groups)  
3. ✅ View ALL customers from all teams (5/5 customers)
4. ✅ Full executive access to organizational data

The system now provides proper hierarchical access where executives have full organizational visibility while maintaining appropriate access controls for other roles.
