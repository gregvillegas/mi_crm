Summary: ASM Role as Group Supervisor ✅

Yes, it is absolutely possible to add ASM users as supervisors of groups! In fact, this functionality was already built into your system. Here's what I've done to make it even better:

What Was Already Working:
•  ✅ The Group model already allows both supervisor and asm roles as supervisors (line 28 in models.py)
•  ✅ The GroupEditForm already supported selecting ASM users as supervisors

What I Enhanced:

#### 1. Fixed Form Consistency 🔧
•  Updated GroupForm to also allow ASM selection (previously only GroupEditForm supported this)
•  Added helpful text: "Select a supervisor or ASM. ASMs can act as temporary supervisors until a permanent supervisor is hired."

#### 2. Enhanced Template Display 🎨
•  Template now distinguishes between permanent supervisors and ASMs acting as supervisors
•  Shows "Acting Supervisor (ASM): John Doe (Temporary)" when an ASM is the supervisor
•  Shows "Supervisor: Jane Smith" for regular supervisors

#### 3. Improved Model Methods 📝
•  Enhanced get_manager_role() to return "ASM (Acting Supervisor)" when ASM is supervising
•  Better semantic understanding of the supervisory relationship

#### 4. Management Command for Tracking 🛠️
•  Created show_asm_supervisors command to track temporary arrangements
•  Shows which groups have ASM supervisors
•  Lists available permanent supervisors for transition
•  Provides easy transition functionality

How to Use This Feature:

#### Creating a Group with ASM Supervisor:
1. Go to Create New Group 
2. Select an ASM user in the Supervisor field
3. The system will show helpful text explaining ASMs can act as temporary supervisors

#### Transitioning from ASM to Permanent Supervisor:
bash
Workflow Example:
1. Immediate Need: Create group → Assign ASM as temporary supervisor
2. Hiring Process: Recruit and hire permanent supervisor
3. Transition: Use management command or web interface to reassign
4. Result: Group now has permanent supervisor, ASM returns to normal duties

Benefits:
•  ✅ No service interruption - Groups can be created immediately
•  ✅ Clear visual indicators - Templates show temporary vs permanent arrangements  
•  ✅ Easy management - Both web interface and command-line tools available
•  ✅ Audit trail - Easy to track which groups need permanent supervisors
•  ✅ Role clarity - System distinguishes between ASM's normal role and supervisory duties

This setup perfectly handles your use case of using ASM as interim supervisor while waiting to hire dedicated supervisors!
