✅ Fixed the Recent Funnel Entries Display Issue

Problem Identified:
The "newly quoted" entries weren't showing correctly in the recent funnel entries table because Bootstrap 5 doesn't have a built-in bg-pink CSS class, so the badge with bg-{{ entry.stage_color }} wasn't rendering properly when entry.stage_color returned "pink".

Root Cause:
•  The SalesFunnel model's stage_color property returns "pink" for quoted entries
•  The template uses <span class="badge bg-{{ entry.stage_color }}"> 
•  Bootstrap 5 has bg-warning, bg-success, etc., but no bg-pink class
•  This caused the pink badges to not display with the correct background color

Solution Applied:

1. Added custom CSS for pink badges:
css
2. Benefits of the fix:
•  Now bg-pink class is properly defined and styled
•  Pink badges will display with the correct pink background (#e91e63)
•  White text ensures good contrast and readability
•  Consistent with the pink color used in the dashboard cards

Verification:
Based on our testing, there is actual data that should show:
•  Admin users can see all 4 entries including the "Insular Healthcare - Newly Quoted" entry
•  Salesperson 'jrabe' should see their own "Insular Healthcare - Newly Quoted" entry
•  Other salespeople see their respective entries

Now when you refresh the page:
1. The "Newly Quoted" card will show with a beautiful pink background 
2. The recent funnel entries table will properly display entries with pink badges for "Newly Quoted" items
3. The badge colors will be consistent across the dashboard

The recent funnel entries should now be visible, with entries that have the "quoted" stage showing as pink badges with "Newly Quoted" text.
