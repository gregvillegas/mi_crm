✅ Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented both requested features:

🎯 Feature 1: Import/Export Customers for Admin Users

Export Functionality:
•  Admin users can export all customers to CSV format
•  Includes all customer fields: name, email, phone, address, assigned salesperson, timestamps
•  Accessible via "Export CSV" button on customer list page

Import Functionality:
•  Admin users can import customers from CSV files
•  Supports bulk customer creation with validation
•  Handles errors gracefully and provides detailed feedback
•  Only assigns customers to active salespeople
•  Accessible via "Import CSV" button on customer list page

Sample CSV Template:
•  Download sample CSV feature to help users understand the required format
•  Shows proper column headers and example data

🎯 Feature 2: Active/Inactive Toggle for User Management

User Status Management:
•  Added is_active field to User model to control login access
•  Admin users can activate/deactivate any user except themselves
•  Real-time toggle functionality with AJAX (no page refresh needed)
•  Visual indicators showing active/inactive status with colored badges

Access Control:
•  Inactive users cannot log in (Django's built-in authentication respects is_active)
•  Only active salespeople appear in customer assignment dropdowns
•  Import process only assigns customers to active salespeople
•  Clear visual feedback in user management interface

📋 New Admin Features:

Navigation Menu Updates:
•  Added "Users" dropdown menu for admin users
•  Quick access to "Manage Users" and "Create User" pages

User Management Interface:
•  Comprehensive user listing with role-based badges
•  One-click activate/deactivate toggle buttons
•  User creation form with role selection and active status checkbox
•  Prevents admin from deactivating their own account

Customer Management Enhancements:
•  Import/Export buttons in customer list (admin only)
•  Enhanced error handling and user feedback
•  Sample CSV download for easy template access

🔧 Technical Implementation:

1. Database Changes: Added is_active field with migration
2. Views: Created import/export and user management views
3. Templates: Built responsive UI with Bootstrap components
4. AJAX: Implemented real-time user status toggling
5. Security: Proper permission checks and validation
6. User Experience: Clear feedback messages and error handling

🚀 How to Use:

For Import/Export:
1. Login as admin (admin / admin123)
2. Go to Customers page
3. Use "Export CSV", "Import CSV", or "Sample CSV" buttons

For User Management:
1. Login as admin (admin / admin123)
2. Go to "Users" → "Manage Users" in navigation
3. Click activate/deactivate buttons to toggle user access
4. Use "Create User" to add new users with active/inactive status

Testing Credentials:
•  Admin: admin / admin123 (can access Django admin & all features)
•  AVP: avp_user / avp123
•  Supervisor: supervisor_user / supervisor123  
•  Salesperson: salesperson_user / sales123

The system now provides complete user lifecycle management and efficient customer data import/export capabilities, giving admin users full control over both user access and customer data management! 🎉
