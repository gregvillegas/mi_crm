Summary

I have successfully implemented both requested features:

1. ✅ Edit User Functionality
•  Added Edit button in the Actions column of the User Management page
•  Created edit_user view in users/views.py that allows editing:
•  Username, Email, First Name, Last Name
•  User Role (admin, avp, supervisor, salesperson)
•  Password (optional - leave blank to keep current)
•  Active status
•  Created edit_user.html template with a user-friendly form
•  Added URL route /users/edit/<user_id>/
•  Added proper validation to prevent duplicate usernames/emails (excluding the current user)

2. ✅ Transfer Salesperson to Another Group
•  Added Transfer button (only visible for salesperson role) in the Actions column
•  Created transfer_salesperson view that:
•  Shows current group assignment
•  Lists all available groups with team and supervisor info
•  Prevents selecting the current group
•  Creates or updates TeamMembership records
•  Created transfer_salesperson.html template with dropdown selection
•  Added URL route /users/transfer/<user_id>/
•  Added proper permissions (managers can transfer salespersons)

3. ✅ Enhanced User Interface
•  Updated User Management template with:
•  Button groups for better organization
•  Font Awesome icons for visual clarity
•  Conditional display (Transfer button only for salespersons)
•  Better button styling and tooltips
•  Added Font Awesome icons to base template
•  Improved JavaScript for toggle functionality with proper icon updates

4. ✅ Testing Results
•  Edit functionality - Successfully tested editing multiple users
•  Transfer functionality - Successfully tested transferring salesperson between groups
•  UI improvements - Buttons display correctly with icons and proper styling
•  Validation - Proper error handling and success messages
•  Permissions - Only admins can edit users, managers can transfer salespersons

The user management system now provides comprehensive functionality for:
•  ✅ Editing user details (previously only deactivate was available)
•  ✅ Transferring salespersons to different groups (new functionality)
•  ✅ Better user experience with clear visual indicators and organized actions

Both features are fully functional and have been tested successfully!
