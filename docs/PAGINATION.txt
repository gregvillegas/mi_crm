🎉 Pagination Implementation Complete

Features Added:

1. Pagination Controls: 
•  Previous/Next navigation
•  First/Last page links
•  Page number display with smart ellipsis for large page counts
•  Current page highlighting
2. Page Size Options: 
•  Dropdown to select 10, 20, 50, or 100 users per page
•  Defaults to 20 users per page
3. Search Functionality:
•  Search by username, first name, last name, or email
•  Search results are preserved when navigating pages
•  Clear search button when a search is active
4. User-Friendly Information:
•  Shows current range (e.g., "Showing 1 to 20 of 150 users")
•  Displays total user count
•  Shows search results context when filtering
•  Page information (e.g., "Page 2 of 8")

Key Improvements:

✅ Better Navigation: No more endless scrolling through hundreds of users  
✅ Faster Loading: Only loads 20 users by default instead of all users  
✅ Search Capability: Quickly find specific users  
✅ Flexible Display: Choose how many users to view per page  
✅ State Preservation: Search queries and page sizes are maintained when navigating  

Technical Implementation:

•  Backend: Updated user_management view with Django's Paginator class
•  Frontend: Added Bootstrap pagination components with proper URL parameter handling  
•  Search: Uses Django's Q objects for multiple field search
•  URL Parameters: Properly handles page, page_size, and search parameters

The implementation has been tested and is working correctly as evidenced by the server logs showing successful pagination navigation, page size changes, and search functionality.
