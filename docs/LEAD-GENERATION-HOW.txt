✅ Lead Generation System is Now Accessible!

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the lead generation system and made it accessible to salespeople. Here's how salespeople can now access it:

🚀 How Salespeople Access Lead Generation:

#### 1. Through the Navigation Menu
When a salesperson logs in, they'll see a new "Lead Generation" dropdown menu in the navigation bar with these options:
•  Lead Dashboard - Overview of all lead metrics
•  My Leads - Personal lead pipeline 
•  🔥 Hot Leads - High-priority/high-score leads
•  Add New Lead - Create new leads

#### 2. Direct URLs Available:
•  Main Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/leads/
•  My Leads: http://localhost:8000/leads/my-leads/
•  Create Lead: http://localhost:8000/leads/leads/create/
•  Hot Leads: http://localhost:8000/leads/hot-leads/

🎯 What Salespeople Can Do:

#### Lead Management:

•  ✅ View their personal lead pipeline with scores and priorities
