3. ✅ Views Updated with History Logging:

Still Needed:

1. Customer History Template: Create templates/customers/customer_history.html
2. URL Configuration: Add history route to customers/urls.py

4. Transfer Customer Logging: Update transfer function with history logging
5. Customer Creation Logging: Add history entry when customers are created

Key Benefits Implemented:
