✅ Sample CSV Format Updated Successfully!

I've successfully updated the sample CSV to match the exact format of the export CSV from the customer management page. Here's what has been implemented:

Key Changes Made:

1. Sample CSV Header Updated: 
•  Before: 6 columns (Company Name, Contact Person Name, Email, Phone Number, Address, Salesperson Username)
•  After: 12 columns matching export format exactly
2. Enhanced Import Functionality:
•  Full field support: Now handles Industry, Territory, VIP Status, Active Status
•  Smart field mapping: Automatically maps industry/territory display names to database values
•  Flexible boolean parsing: Accepts "Yes/No", "True/False", or "1/0" for status fields
•  Comprehensive validation: Better error messages for invalid data
3. Updated Sample Data:
•  Realistic examples: 3 sample rows with different scenarios
•  Correct choice values: Uses actual territory/industry options from your model
•  Variety in data: Shows VIP/non-VIP, active/inactive, with/without salesperson
4. Improved Documentation:
•  Updated import template: Clear instructions about all available fields
•  Choice value examples: Shows users what values are valid for dropdown fields
•  Better user guidance: Clear indication of required vs optional fields

New CSV Format (12 columns):

Sample Data Examples:
•  VIP Technology Company in Makati with assigned salesperson
•  Regular Manufacturing Company in Pasig without salesperson  
•  VIP Finance Company in Ortigas that's currently inactive

Benefits:
✅ Perfect Export/Import Compatibility: Sample CSV now exactly matches export format  
✅ Complete Data Import: Can now import all customer fields, not just basic info  
✅ Better User Experience: Clear instructions and realistic examples  
✅ Robust Error Handling: Smart field validation and helpful error messages  
✅ Backwards Compatible: Still works with old 6-column CSV files  

The updated sample CSV will now provide users with a complete template that matches your export format exactly, making it much easier to bulk import customer data with all the available fields populated correctly.
