I see the issue! The user pcruz is in group CSG-B but we're testing with group CSG-A, so they don't have access. This is working correctly. 

To access the file upload page, you need to:

1. Log in to the CRM
2. Navigate to your group's page:
•  Go to Teams → All Groups
•  Find your group in the list
•  Click on your group name to view group members
•  Click the "Group Files" button (green button with file icon)
3. From the group files page:
•  Click the "Upload File" button in the top-right

Let me show you the direct navigation path. What's your current username and role in the system? You can also try these direct URLs (replace <group_id> with your group's ID):

•  For group files: http://localhost:8000/files/group/<group_id>/files/
•  For file upload: http://localhost:8000/files/group/<group_id>/upload/

Let me help you find the right group ID for your user:
Perfect! Now I can give you the exact navigation path. Here's how to access the file upload page:

🎯 Navigation Path to File Upload:

Option 1: Through Group Navigation
1. Login to the CRM at http://localhost:8000/
2. Go to Teams → All Groups 
3. Find your group in the list (depends on your username - see mappings above)
4. Click on your group name to view group members
5. Click the green "Group Files" button
6. Click "Upload File" button in the top-right

Option 2: Direct URLs (replace with your group ID)
Based on the user mappings above, here are some direct links:

•  CSG-B (Group ID: 4): http://localhost:8000/files/group/4/upload/
•  CSG-E (Group ID: 2): http://localhost:8000/files/group/2/upload/
•  CSG-F (Group ID: 1): http://localhost:8000/files/group/1/upload/
•  TSG-A (Group ID: 5): http://localhost:8000/files/group/5/upload/

Option 3: Through Files Menu
1. Click "Files" in the main navigation
2. Select "All Group Files" 
3. Choose a group from the accessible groups
4. Click "Upload File"

🔍 To Find Your Specific Group:
Tell me your username and I can give you the exact URL for your group's file upload page!

🚀 Quick Test:
Try this URL to see all your accessible files: http://localhost:8000/files/all-files/

The file upload functionality is working - you just need to access it through the correct group that you have permissions for. What's your username in the system?
